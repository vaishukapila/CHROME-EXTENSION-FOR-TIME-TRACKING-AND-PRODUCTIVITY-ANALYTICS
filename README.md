description task 4:

For Task 4 of my internship project, I developed a Chrome Extension for Time Tracking and Productivity Analytics using a full-stack development. The objective of this project was to create a tool that could help users monitor their online activity, track the time they spend on different websites, and provide insights into their digital productivity. This task helped me apply real-world concepts of browser extension development, backend API handling, frontend data visualization, and integration of multiple technologies into one cohesive application.

The project consists of three core components: the Chrome Extension, a backend API, and a React-based dashboard. The Chrome Extension runs in the background and keeps track of which website the user is actively browsing. It monitors tab activity using Chrome's tab APIs and records the time spent on each website. This data is then categorized as either productive (like coding websites such as GitHub or Stack Overflow) or unproductive (such as YouTube ) based on a predefined list. The collected data is sent to a Node.js + Express backend that stores it in a MongoDB database, allowing it to be fetched and visualized later.

The dashboard was built using React.js and Chart.js, where I displayed the analytics in the form of a pie chart. It fetches the usage data from the backend and visually represents the proportion of time spent on productive versus unproductive websites for a given time period. This chart helps users understand their browsing patterns and improve their focus by making better time management decisions. For development, I used VS Code as my primary IDE due to its powerful debugging features and extension support, which made it easier to manage JavaScript and React codebases efficiently.

To overcome challenges during development and debugging, I actively used AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini, and DeepSeek, which provided me with valuable code suggestions, syntax corrections, and logic improvements. These tools were particularly helpful when dealing with asynchronous behavior in JavaScript, managing state in React, and designing the Chrome Extension's manifest and background scripts. Additionally, I referred to YouTube videos to understand complex concepts like service workers, API integration, and Chrome extension permission models. 

This project was a great learning experience for real world problem I learned how to handle CORS, securely store credentials using .env files, and use MongoDB Atlas for remote data storage. I also gained experience in debugging frontend and backend issues and ensuring the real-time functionality of the extension. Overall, Task 4 gave me practical exposure to full-stack development and strengthened my confidence in building scalable, real-world applications. It also helped me learn how to use modern AI tools and online resources to enhance the speed and quality of my development process.
